    {
      question: "How do I start investing?",
      answer: "Open an account in a few minutes and complete our simple KYC process. Once approved, you can immediately start a SIP or make a lump-sum investment. Our app will guide you step by step through the entire process."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I withdraw money anytime?",
      answer: "Yes. Mutual funds are generally liquid. You can redeem your investments at any time without penalty. Fund houses usually process redemptions within 1‚Äì3 business days. However, ELSS funds have a 3-year lock-in period."
    },
    {
      question: "Are my investments safe?",
      answer: "Fortune Basket is a SEBI-registered mutual fund distributor. We partner only with regulated asset management companies. Your funds are held by independent custodians, just as they would be directly with the fund. That said, all investing carries market risk ‚Äì the value of your investments can go down as well as up."
    },
    {
      question: "What fees does Fortune Basket charge?",
      answer: "We charge a simple annual fee (0.60% p.a.) to manage your portfolio, with no hidden charges. This fee is built into the platform so you always see net returns. There are no transaction fees or exit loads beyond what the funds themselves charge. We believe in full transparency."
    },
    {
      question: "What risks should I be aware of?",
      answer: "Like any stock-market-linked investment, mutual funds involve risk. The value of your investments can go down as well as up. You should invest only after reading the fund's scheme documents. We provide all required information so you can make informed choices. We also recommend diversifying across different fund types to mitigate risk."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get help if I have questions?",
      answer: "Our customer support team is ready to assist via email or chat. We also have a detailed Help Center and educational resources built into the app. If you prefer a human touch, our advisors can speak with you directly to clarify any doubts at no extra cost."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the minimum investment amount?",
      answer: "You can start investing with as little as ‚Çπ1,000 per month through SIPs. For lump sum investments, the minimum amount varies by fund but typically starts from ‚Çπ5,000. This makes investing accessible to everyone."
    },
    {
      question: "How often can I monitor my investments?",
      answer: "You can monitor your portfolio 24/7 through our real-time dashboard. Get instant reports, performance charts, and goal progress updates. We also send smart notifications to keep you informed about important developments."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes Fortune Basket different?",
      answer: "We combine low-cost passive investing with smart technology and human expertise. Our platform offers goal-based planning, automated rebalancing, and transparent fee structure. We focus on index funds and ETFs to minimize costs while maximizing market exposure."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I change my SIP amount or frequency?",
      answer: "Yes, you have complete flexibility to modify your SIP amount, change frequency, or pause/resume SIPs anytime. Our platform makes it easy to adjust your investments as your financial situation changes."
